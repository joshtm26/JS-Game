This game is a two player fighting game that uses wasd and arrow keys as the control scheme, 
specific controls listed below. It is inspired by an indie game called One Strike. In this game 
it only takes a single attack to kill your opponent, making it so that you have to be careful 
about when you strike becuase it could cause fatal. After attacking there is a brief period of 
time in which you are unable to block or attack again, giving the opponent a crucial opening if 
they are able to dodge or block the attack. 

I do not own the assets used but all of them are under CC0 aside from the Tekken 3 background music. 
All of the code in this project was written by me.
